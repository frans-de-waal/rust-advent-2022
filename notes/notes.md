## Installation

### `rustup`

https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html#installation

A command line tool for managing Rust versions and associated tools.

- Updating Rust:  `$ rustup update`

### Local docs

The installation of Rust also includes a local copy of the documentation so that you can read it offline. Run `rustup doc` to open the local documentation in your browser.

### Basics

- Rust source files use the `.rs` file extension.
    - Convention is to use underscores for whitespace in filenames.
- `main` function is always the first code that runs in every executable Rust program.
- `rustfmt` code formatter
    - 4 space indentation convention
- Using `!` means calling a macro in stead of a function.
- Compiling and Running are seperate steps.
    - Compile using `rustc main.rs`. It outputs a binary executable.
    - Run the application by calling the executable `./main`.
- **Cargo** is Rust's build system and package manager.
    - Cargo handles a lot of tasks for you, such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code depends on, and building those libraries.
- Create a new project using Cargo: `cargo new project_name`
    - Creates a `Cargo.toml` file, Cargo's configuration file (*see [TOML](https://toml.io/en/)*).
    - Creates a `src` directory with a `main.rs` file.
    - Initialises a Git repository if not already in one.
- Building and running a Cargo project
    - Build: `cargo build`
        - Creates an executable `target/debug/` directory (*default build is a debug build*).
        - Creates a `Cargo.lock` file, keeps track of the exact version dependencies in the project.
    - Run: `cargo run` compiles the code and runs the resultant executable.
    - `cargo check` quickly checks your code to make sure it compiles but doesnâ€™t produce an executable.
    - Build (and optimise) for release: `cargo build --release`. 
        - Will create an executable in `/target/release`

### Package configuration

#### `[package]`

Section defining the project.

- `name`: Name of the project.
- `version`: Version of the project.
- `edition`: Edition of Rust to use.

#### `[dependencies]`

Dependencies for the the project. Packages of code are referred to as *crates*.
